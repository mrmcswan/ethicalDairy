			<h3>The story behing #cooseday livestreams </h3>
			
			<p> Several months ago, just after the excitement of the cows and calves going out to pasture for the summer, we took a moment to quietly watch them, all relaxed and happy munching away on the lush green grass in beautiful countryside.</p>

			<p>We decided to have a go on Tuesdays, re-named #coosdays on Scottish social media (courtesy of VisitScotland who like to demonstrate each Tuesday just how attractive cows look in the Scottish countryside). </p>
