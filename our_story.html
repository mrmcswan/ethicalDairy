		<h2> Our Story</h2>

	
			<h3> Our Big Idea </h3>
			
			<p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? </p>
    
			<p> A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our ethical dairy model is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness. </p>
	

	
			<h3>The Ethical Journey So Far</h3>

			<p> Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day. </p>

			<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of antibiotics, increases in biodiversity and healthier, happier cows. </p>



			<h3> Join Our Revolution </h3>

			<p> Healthier, happier cows and calves are the goal of our radical new dairy system, alongside of course producing milk with which to make our delicious cheese. If you’re interested in helping us prove that commercial dairy farming can be ethical, sustainable and compassionate, then please sign up for our supporters newsletter below.</p>
