		<p> We produce traditional cheeses made with unpasteurised organic milk sourced from our own dairy herd, where we keep the calves with their mothers to suckle.</p>
			
		<p> Our ethical dairy model is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.  </p>
